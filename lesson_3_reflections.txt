When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When i want contributors to work on the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If i had several branches (and some branches for testing), maybe i would want to change what branches to pull
