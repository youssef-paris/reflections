When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When i want contributors to work on the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If i had several branches (and some branches for testing), maybe i would want to change what branches to pull

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Cloning can be made locally.
	A fork is a fancy clone of a repository directly made on github
	A branch can only made within a repository and doesn't involve another

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It makes easier to resolve merge conflicts in the case of several commits made by several contributors

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Yes, it would be easier since we can see contributions faster. The contributors can be very at a great distance from us.
	But I hope that we can protect the master branch, and allow contributors to pull to another branch but not the master...
