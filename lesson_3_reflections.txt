When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When i want contributors to work on the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If i had several branches (and some branches for testing), maybe i would want to change what branches to pull

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Cloning can be made locally.
	A fork is a fancy clone of a repository directly made on github
	A branch can only made within a repository and doesn't involve another
